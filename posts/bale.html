          Home to the endangered Ethiopian wolf, mountain nyala, and stunning Afro-alpine moorland. Trek through 
          Sanetti Plateau (over 4,000m) and explore Harenna Forest. Bring warm layers!
        </p>

        <h2>Wildlife spotting</h2>
        <p>
          The park is home to the Ethiopian wolf (the rarest canid in the world), mountain nyala, Bale monkey, 
          and over 300 bird species. The best time to see Ethiopian wolves is early morning on the Sanetti Plateau. 
          You'll need patience and a good guide, but spotting one is an unforgettable experience.
        </p>

        <h2>Sanetti Plateau</h2>
        <p>
          At over 4,000 meters, this is the highest all-weather road in Africa. The landscape is otherworldly— 
          giant lobelia plants, Afro-alpine vegetation, and often misty conditions. It's cold up here, so bring 
          warm clothes even if it's hot in the lowlands. The plateau is accessible by 4WD vehicle.
        </p>

        <h2>Harenna Forest</h2>
        <p>
          A completely different ecosystem from the plateau. This is a cloud forest with giant trees, moss, and 
          a chance to see Bale monkeys and other forest wildlife. The contrast between the high plateau and the 
          forest is striking and shows the park's incredible biodiversity.
        </p>

        <h2>Trekking options</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Day trips</strong> — explore the plateau or forest on guided day hikes.</li>
          <li><strong>Multi-day treks</strong> — 2-4 day treks that take you through different ecosystems.</li>
          <li><strong>Mount Batu</strong> — climb Ethiopia's second-highest peak (4,307m) on a challenging trek.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Practical tips</h2>
        <p>
          You must hire a guide and scout (mandatory for safety). The park entrance fee is around 200 ETB per day. 
          Accommodation options range from camping to basic lodges. The best time to visit is during the dry season 
          (October to April). Altitude sickness can be an issue, so acclimatize in Addis Ababa first. Bring warm 
          layers, waterproof gear, and good hiking boots.
        </p>

        <h2>Getting there</h2>
        <p>
          The park is about 400 km southeast of Addis Ababa. You can drive (6-7 hours) or fly to Goba and drive from there. 
          A 4WD vehicle is essential for exploring the park. Most visitors base themselves in Dinsho (park headquarters) 
          or Goba town.
