          A relaxed lakeside city in the Great Rift Valley. Watch pelicans at the fish market, enjoy fresh tilapia, 
          and explore the nearby hot springs. Perfect for a chill break.
        </p>

        <h2>Lake Hawassa</h2>
        <p>
          The lake is the main attraction. It's perfect for bird watching—you'll see pelicans, cormorants, and 
          various other water birds. The lakeside promenade is great for evening walks. You can also take boat trips 
          on the lake, though they're more for the experience than seeing anything specific.
        </p>

        <h2>Fish market</h2>
        <p>
          The morning fish market is a must-see. Local fishermen bring in their catch, and pelicans gather to 
          snatch scraps. It's a unique spectacle and great for photos. The market is most active early in the morning 
          (around 7-9 AM). Afterward, you can buy fresh fish and have it cooked at nearby restaurants.
        </p>

        <h2>What to eat</h2>
        <p>
          Fresh tilapia is the star here. You can have it grilled, fried, or cooked in a spicy sauce. Most restaurants 
          along the lake serve it. Also try local Sidamo coffee—the region is known for producing some of Ethiopia's best coffee.
        </p>

        <h2>Day trips</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Wondo Genet Hot Springs</strong> — about 30 km away, natural hot springs perfect for relaxation.</li>
          <li><strong>Abijatta-Shalla National Park</strong> — two lakes with flamingos and other birdlife (about 1 hour drive).</li>
          <li><strong>Shashemene</strong> — Rastafarian community town, interesting cultural experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting there</h2>
        <p>
          Hawassa is about 275 km south of Addis Ababa. You can drive (4-5 hours) or take a bus. The city is flat and 
          easy to navigate. Bajajs are the main form of transport within the city and are very affordable.
